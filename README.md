# Create a Tableau Story
Project part of Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Project Overview
This Tableau Story visualizes the state of global terrorism from 1998 to 2017, starting with a broad global total picture, then moving to terrorism in specific regions and countries and ending with a narrow perspective on the terrorist groups behind the attacks. The data used for this story comes from the Global Terrorism Database that includes information on terrorist attacks in the world from 1970 to 2017 and is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).
